# MixALime: Mixture models for Allelic Imbalance Estimation

**If you use Python 3.10+, please install datatable 1.1+ from git prior to installing MixALime. It might fail in some conda environments due to the outdated versions of libstdcxx-ng: make sure you have the latest version by running "conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng" beforehand.**

**MixALime** is a tool for the identification of allele-specific events in high-throughput sequencing data. It works by modelling counts data as a mixture of two Negative Binomial or Beta Negative Binomial distributions (where the latter is more applicable in case of noisy data at a cost of loss of sensitivity).
## System requirements
### OS
In our work, we mostly used *Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-82-generic x86_64)* and *Manjaro 6.1.62-1*. We never tested **MixALime** on Windows systems.
### Software dependencies
**MixALime** is best used with *Python 3.9*. If one is to use later versions of *Python* (e.g. 3.10, 3.11), install **datatable 1.1+** manually beforehand as it is not yet at the **pypi** repository.
Package dependencies that could affect **MixALime** results are the **JAX  0.4.20**, **scipy 1.11.3** and **numpy 1.26.2**.
### Hardware requirements
It is best to use **MixALime** with plenty of RAM available if one wishes to use the parallelization to the full extent. In that case, make sure that your system has at least 16GB of RAM. However, the RAM requirement is depends on a dataset.

## Installation guide
**MixALime** can be easily installed with the **pip** package manager.
```
> pip3 install mixalime
```
Alternatively, **MixALime** can be installed from the git repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/autosome-ru/MixALime 
> cd MixALime 
> python3 setup.py install
```
Regardless of the chosen method, installation time of the **MixALime** alone is capped by the internet connection speed, but should take no longer than a minute, granted that all the dependency packages are already installed.
## Instructions for use
The package is *almost* easy to use and we advise everyone to just jump straight to installing **MixALime** and invoking the help command in a command line:

```
> pip3 install mixalime
> mixalime --help
```

We believe that the help section of **MixALime** covers its functionality well enough. Furthermore, the package arrives with a small demo dataset included and an easy-to-follow instruction in the abovementioned help section. Furthermore, note that all commands avaliable in **MixALime**'s command-line interface have their own `help` page too, e.g.:
```
> mixalime fit --help
```

So do not waste your time looking for how-to-clues or tutorials here, just use `--help`. 

Yet, for the sake of following the social norms that impose a requirement of README files to be useful, in the next section you'll find the excerpt from `--help` command as well as some other possibly useful details:

### Demo
A typical **MixALime** session consists of sequential runs of `create`, `fit`, `test`, `combine` and, finally, `export all`, `plot` commands. For instance, we provide a demo dataset that consists of a bunch of BED-like files with allele counts at SNVs (just for the record, **MixALime** can work with most vcf and  BED-like file formats):
```
> mixalime export demo
```
A *scorefiles* folder should appear now in a working directory with a plenty of BED-like files.
First, we'd like to parse those files into a **MixALime**-friendly and efficient data structures for further usage, as well as perform some basic filtering if necessary:
```
> mixalime create myprojectname scorefiles --no-snp-bad-check
```
Expected output:
```

By default, MixALime throws an error if the same SNV belongs regions of different background allelic dosage ([BAD](https://adastra.autosome.org/bill-cipher/help)) in data, as it is not possible in a single cell type. However, for datasets of multiple samples, this is fully OK, hence we turn this check off with the `--no-snp-bad-check`. The output:

Then we fit model parameters to the data with Negative Binomial distribution:
```
> mixalime fit myprojectname NB
```
Expected output:
```

size (1143 < 10000). Number of samples is too small for a sensible 
fit, a conservative fit will be used.

Warnings are fine. More on them in the [tutorial](http://mixalime.georgy.top/tutorial/quickstart.html#Example).
Next we obtain raw p-values:
```
> mixalime test myprojectname
```
Expected output:
```
✔️ Done!  time: 47.96 s.
```
Usually we'd want to combine p-values across samples and apply a FDR correction:
```
> mixalime combine myprojectname
```
Expected output:

Finally, we obtain fancy plots fir diagnostic purposes and easy-to-work-with tabular data:
```
> mixalime export all myprojectname results_folder
> mixalime plot myprojectname results_folder
```
Expected output:

You'll find everything of interest in *results_folder*.



### Combination of p-values across groups

*Note: a popular synonym for "combination" in this context is _aggregation_.*

One important feature that is not covered by the glorified `--help` in a very obvious fashion is a combination of p-values across separate groups (e.g. one group can be a treatment and the other is a control). The `combine` command with default options combines all the p-values. This can be changed by supplying the `--group` option followed by either a list of filenames that make up that group or a file that contains a list (newline-separated) of those files (the most convenient approach, probably), e.g.:
```
> mixalime combine --subname treatment -g vcfs/file1.vcf.gz -g vfcfs/file2.vfc.gz -g vcfs/file3.vcf.gz myproject
> mixalime combine --subname control -g vcfs/file4.vcf.gz -g vfcfs/file5.vfc.gz -g vcfs/file6.vcf.gz myproject
```
or
```
> mixalime combine --subname treatment -g group_treatment.tsv combine myproject
> mixalime combine --subname control -g group_control.tsv combine myproject
```
The `--subname` option is necessary if you wish to avoid different `combine` invocations overwriting each other.

### Scoring models
The package provides a variety of models for datasets of varying dispersion:
| Name               | Dataset variance | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NB                 | Low              | Fastest parameter estimation; might be too liberal for some datasets                                                                                                                                 |
| MCNB               | Medium-low       | Marginalized Compound Negative Binomial (MCNB), the safest compromise between liberal NB and conservative BetaNB                                                                                                                                     |
| BetaNB             | High             | Introduces an extra parameter to control for higher variance, fits most datasets perfectly, yet the scoring is often overly conservative                                                             |
| Regularized BetaNB | Depends          | Introduces penalty on the extra parameter to make the model less likely to overfit with the `--regul-a` command. Requires tuning the regularization hyperparameter alpha which might not be feasible |

The name of the appropriate model is supplied to the `fit` command as an argument (except for regularized BetaNB which is just an `fit ProjectName BetaNB` with an `--regul-a alpha_value` option where `alpha_value` is your hyperparameter value, e.g. `1.0`).
### Binomial and beta-binomial models
**MixALime** also can do good old-fashion binomial and beta-binomial tests. They can be done with the separate `test_binom` (with `--beta` flag if you want beta-binomial). Note, that with this command you can skip the `fit` (as not fit is done here, except for beta-binomial, where a single variance parameter is estimated for each BAD) and `test` step.

Compared to classic association studies, allelic imbalance at heterozygous variants captures the functional effects of the regulatory genome variation with smaller sample sizes and higher sensitivity. Yet, the identification of allele-specific events from allelic read counts remains non-trivial due to multiple sources of technical and biological variability, which induce data-dependent biases and overdispersion. Here we present MIXALIME, a novel computational framework for calling allele-specific events in diverse omics data with a repertoire of statistical models accounting for read mapping bias and copy-number variation. We benchmark MIXALIME against existing tools and demonstrate its practical usage by constructing an atlas of allele-specific chromatin accessibility, UDACHA, from thousands of available datasets obtained from diverse cell types.Availability https://github.com/autosome-ru/MixALime, https://udacha.autosome.orgCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
